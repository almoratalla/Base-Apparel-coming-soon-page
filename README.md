- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My initial design choice for this single page is to either separate the image and the main section to separate containers or just keep it straight forward. But to keep it relatively simple, semantic and consistent, I just used a `global container` that will be a flex box that will hold its children into a column. The separation of the `image` and `main` section during desktop view depends on the `order` of the image to keep it on the right side.

### Continued development

I think this is pretty much done. Other possible continuation for this is the addition of connection to api's, connection to a newsletter service or storing of the email to a database

### Useful resources
